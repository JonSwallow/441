## Homework 4
### Technical Report
## Overview
This week was a struggle from start to finish and still I have not completed what I set out to do.
This seemed like a very large amount of material for one week and some of it was not very helpful.

### Code
```
// This code may produce the results, but it does not meet the requirements.
var loop = function (n) {
  if (n => n, n >0 ) {
  console.log(n);
  return loop(n- 1);
   }
};

loop(3, n => n > 0, n => n - 1, console.log);

var loop = function (n) {
  if (n => n, n >0 ) {
  console.log(n);
  return loop(n- 1);
   }
};

loop(1, n =>n<=10, n=>n+3, console.log);
```

### Results

### Problems
Too many to name
### Community Spirit
We all tried to help eachother this week we have a group of five or so of us on Discord.
### Conclusions
I will continue to try and build on my coding abilities thoroughout the semester. I am sure it will be worthwhile and rewarding in the end.
I know it will become more evident as time passes and I will become good at coding.
