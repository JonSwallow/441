### Problems
Well I hate to admit that I had to review a good bit from last semester to accomplish this.

I was trying to make it way harder than it had to be.

### Future work
I believe this was a great review. I feel ready to start creating Webpages on a regular basis. (Knock on wood concerning false bravado.)
### Community Spirit
I will always answer when someone calls.
Subscribed to the issues section on github and linked to my Gmail. If I do not know the answer I will try and find out. I think asking for help is my biggest problem.

### Conclusions
Took me a minute to get back into the fray. I look forward to a good semester. Cheers!!!
