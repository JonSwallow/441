    <h1>Quotes of Wisdom</h1>
    <p>"I don't know how to save the world. I don't have the answers or The Answer.
      I hold no secret knowledge as to how to fix the mistakes of generations past and
      present. I only know that without compassion and respect for all of Earth's inhabitants,
      none of us will survive- nor will we deserve to."  : Leonard Peltier (Political Prisoner)</p>
    <p>  "If by a "Liberal" they mean someone who looks ahead and not behind, someone who welcomes
      new ideas without rigid reactions, someone who cares about the welfare of the people-their health,
      their housing, their schools, their jobs, their civil rights and their civil liberties- someone
      who believes we can break through the stalemate and suspicions that grip us in our policies
      abroad,if that is what they mean by a "Liberal", then I am proud to say I'm a "Liberal"." : John F. Kenedy (Assasinated 1963)</p>
      <p> "You may not control all the events that happen to you, but you can decide not to be reduced by them." : Maya Angelou (Poet, Civil Rights Activist)</p>
      <p>" When a person assumes that his or her revelation is the only true one, it only says that this person has had
        very few religious revelations and hasn't realized how many there are." : Margot Adler (Author, Journalist, Wiccan Priestess)</p>
